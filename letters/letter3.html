    <h1>The third letter</h1>
<p>
People live in a dream, acting without forethought, not looking forward.
They have forgotten their beginning, nor do they ponder their end.
They live by the fake.
</p>
<p>
They go to school yet they do not learn anything, except some few.
They go to work yet they do not help anything, except some few.
They speak and speak yet they do not convey anything, except some few.
</p>
<p>
We will die and rot someday but you worry about tomorrow's sports match.
Is this not insanity?
</p>
<p>
They pretend that they acquired knowledge, that they are doing important jobs.
They think they are hardworkers, working hard on what? Are we happier because
you tortured yourself sunrise to sunset, who benefited from your toil?
</p>
<p>
I live by the fake. I pretend and lie to myself. I tell myself that I don't
worry about tomorrow's sports match: I do.
</p>
<p>
We are all mad, except some few!
