    <h1>The fourteenth letter</h1>
<p>
If I were all alone but were to have many imaginary
friends, and if I had not realize that they were illusions;
would I still be alone?
</p>
<p>
What does it mean to not be alone, what can be considered
as company? Let us first try to discover an answer to this
preliminary question.
</p>
<p>
Humans, without uncertainty, are a company.
Likely also domestic animals of higher intellect
like dogs, cats, and parrots. It is doubtful that
we can add robots even if they can perform richer
interactions than the former. It is generally hard to
call anything nonbiological as a companion.
For things biological, we must discard those with
lesser intellect because there is very little mutual
interaction possible with them. Even if you can
prune the tree, the tree cannot prune you.
This is similarly true for fungi, bacteria, and
similar microscopical life forms.
Another reason we must exclude
simple life forms like bacteria is because we can never
be rid of them and therefore if they are not left out
the word 'alone' would lose its practical meaning.
</p>
<p>
Let us sum our findings: A company is a biological
intellect that can be parted with. We cannot
be parted from ourselves so we cannot be a company
to ourselves, so far so good. But possibly multiple personalities
can reside in the same body, and possibly
they can be parted from each other and be united again.
</p>
<p>
Therefore the answer is 'maybe not(?)'
