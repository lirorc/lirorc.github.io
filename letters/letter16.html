    <h1>The sixteenth letter</h1>
<p>
I have a clock standing on the desk.
It's digital so it blinks.
</p>
<p>
It blinks with agony, and hatred, and disgust.
</p>
<p>
As I stare hallucinating, it stares back.
Stares at me yelling.
Yelling, beeping, beeping.
Yelling, beeping, yelling.
</p>
<p>
It's burning, with foul smoke burning.
That foul smoke, black charcoal cloud.
</p>
<p>
Electrons zipping from the clock.
Zipping through my brain to disturb my thinking.
</p>
<p>
Conspiring, yes conspiring!
</p>
<p>
Standing on the desk;
with beeps and boops whispering.
</p>
<p>
To me whispering.
</p>
<p>
Agony, hatred, and disgust.
</p>
<p>
To me whispering.
</p>
<p>
As I stare hallucinating.
