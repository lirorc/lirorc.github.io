I like the way the spiders live; they do what must be done and
wait patiently. It isn't immediately clear that the web they are
building will someday feed them. The way they hunt is indirect.

I search for myself every day. I try to understand and perhaps
someday learn myself. I have no idea why, but this
is what I must do.

<p>
If and when the time comes what will await me on the web?
