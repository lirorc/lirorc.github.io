    <h1>The twelfth letter</h1>
<p>
I am sorry for not writing you any letters for a while.
</p>
<p>
No, I wasn't busy. It's just that I couldn't think of
anything new to write about.
</p>
<p>
Everything's as usual, you know.
I'm fine though, don't worry about me. By the way how is your
family, are they well? I know things can get a little rough
but go easy on them: I am sure there is no one else that love
you as much. Tell them I said hi; tell them I'm all right.
</p>
<p>
Tell them I'm sorry for what happened.
