    <h1>The eight letter</h1>
<p>
When I am working on a difficult personal project or
learn an interesting and complicated topic,
people sometimes say to me why would I ever want to do
something like that. They tell me what I am working
or studying on has no practical use.
</p>
<p>
If instead I were to spend my time watching videos
on internet or browsing on the newest social media
site, no one would complain.
</p>
<p>
Can't someone just have fun?
