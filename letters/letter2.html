    <h1>The second letter</h1>
<p>
Once I saw a solar eclipse, I still sometimes live in that memory.
</p>
<p>
The sun is brighter than the moon, so the moon hid the sun.
If the moon hid the sun, than the sun was further away to us than the moon.
The sun and the moon appear to us the same size,
even though one is further away.
Therefore the sun is bigger than the moon.
</p>
<p>
If a neophyte is asked why the sun is bright, he might explain in detail
his answer.
If an acolyte is asked why the sun is bright, he might say that he knows
the reason but cannot explain it.
If the master is asked why the sun is bright, he might say he does not know.
If you seek wisdom, seek the master.
</p>
<p>
Once I saw a solar eclipse. Perhaps I missed a second, then I could say twice
I saw a solar eclipse. But I do not say, my tounge is the reader's mind.
Speaking and writing is not a minute difference. I would explain it
(the difference), but it would take hours.
</p>
<p>
What is the meaning of this letter, I do not know.
